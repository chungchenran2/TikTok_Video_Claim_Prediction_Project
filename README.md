# TikTok Video Claim Prediction Project

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a logistic regression, a random forest, and a XGBoost model to predict whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. This project utilized a dataset where each row represents a different published TikTok video in which a claim/opinion has been made. The final random forest model performed with 99.7% accuracy, 99.7% precision, and 99.7% recall in determining if a video is a claim. The final XGBoost model performed with 99.3% accuracy, 99.8% precision, and 98.9% recall in determining if a video is a claim. Based on the metric results, the random forest model is the champion model. According the feature importances plot of the random forest model, the video view count, video like count, and video share count were most influential in determining if a video contains a claim or an opinion.
