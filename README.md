# TikTok Video Claim Prediction Project

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a logistic regression, a random forest, and a XGBoost model to predict whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. This project utilized a dataset where each row represents a different published TikTok video in which a claim/opinion has been made. **(modify from here)** The final random forest model performed with 86% accuracy and 72% precision determining what features were most important in separating low tippers from high tippers. Based on the model, the duration, distance, and cost of the trip were most influential in determining a generous tipper (>20%) vs a non-generous one (<20%).
